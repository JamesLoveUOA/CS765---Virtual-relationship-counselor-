INT. TED’S CAFE - NIGHT

MARY
I thought you had finished your work already.
JIM
Well, Frank went home early and I got stuck with some of his work.
MARY
You said we could have a quiet dinner out. I didn’t think it meant me watching you scribble.
Can at least put that away until after we eat?
JIM
I’m never going to get this report done by tomorrow morning. I just have to...
MARY
Jim. Put it away.
JIM
Just give me a few more minutes.
MARY
Look, you were late coming home, at least you could do is...
JIM
(snapping)
Will you stop already. I was late coming home because of the work. Would you rather I stayed at the office?
MARY
I got a call from Jason’s Principal  today.
