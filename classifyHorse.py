Be direct and resist the urge to mock or insult. Try your best to respect your partner as a person, and be as specific as possible. Ideally you want your partner to understand what you are experiencing, and sympathise with you",

In non-heated situations you should go out of your way to complement your partner, and remind yourself and the two of you do share a love based in mutual appreciation and adoration. Cultivate your love, and contempt will slowly erode away."
